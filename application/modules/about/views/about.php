		<h2>What is code.aurer</h2>
		<p>I'm a big believer in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY principle</a>, if you don't know what that is - it stands for <strong>&quot;Don't repeat yourself&quot;</strong><br/>
		OK So based on that - this is just somewhere to store useful clips of code for use in any of your amazing projects, ensuring you never waste time writing the same code twice.</p>
